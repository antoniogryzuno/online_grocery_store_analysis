# ONLINE GROCERY STORE ANALYSIS 
Initial data and exploratory analysis for the online grocery store Insta.cart, where we have provided valuable insights into sales and suggestions for market segmentation.

## OBJECTIVE 
The Insta.cart stakeholders are particularly interested in the diverse customer base within their database and their purchasing behaviors. Recognizing that a uniform approach won't be effective for all, they are contemplating a targeted marketing strategy. 

The sales team needs to identify the peak order days and times to strategically schedule ads during quieter periods. Additionally, they aim to determine the times of day when customers spend the most, which will influence their product advertising choices. Given the wide range of product prices, the marketing and sales teams seek to use simplified price categories to streamline their efforts. They are also interested in identifying the most popular product types to focus on the departments with the highest order frequencies.

## ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS QUESTIONS 
- How are users distributed in terms of brand loyalty (i.e., how frequently do they return to Instacart)?
  
- Do ordering habits differ based on a customer's loyalty status?

- Are there variations in ordering patterns based on the customer's region?
  
- How do age and family status relate to ordering behaviors?

- What classifications can be derived from demographic information such as age, income, types of goods purchased, and family status?
  
- What distinctions can be observed in the ordering habits of different customer profiles, considering order prices, order frequency, products purchased, and other relevant factors?
